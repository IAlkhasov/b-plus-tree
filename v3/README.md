## BTree Examples 

These _try_ to break down B-Tree Concepts written/disccused in the book [Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/) mostly in chapter 4, but also a kind of summary/amalgamation of chapter's 1-5 with code/examples in go.

You might want to read the [note/crash course article](https://www.hailelagi.com/notes/diy-b-tree/) explaining stuff, but the examples try to be clearly written
from first principles, encourage experimentation or if the implementation is too involved included snippets from an
actual implementation.
